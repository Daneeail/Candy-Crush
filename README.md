# Candy-Crush

The following program mimics the basic functionalities of the popular Candy Crush game.

Allows user to choose coordinates to swap candy.  Checks whether the coordinates are valid.

Depending on the resulting pattern, swapped candy can produce a special type of candy.

Combining psecial candy causes other candy to be crushed in a distinct pattern.

## Directions
The user begins with a 10 x 10 board filled with different colored candy.

The different candy colors are represented on the board with a letter:
  r = red, b = blue, g = green, o = orange, and y = yellow
  
The user chooses coordinates to swap candy.  For the swap to be valid, the user must input valid coordinates that are in proximity to one another and produce a crushable set (3 or more of the same color).

Depending on the pattern produced, the swap may convert the candy into a particular type.

The different types of candy are represented on the board with a letter:
  V = vertical striped, H = horizontal striped, W = wrapped, and C = colored candy.
  
The converted candy crushes other candy with a particular pattern when crushed.

Combining two special candies also produced unique patterns when combined by a swap.

In addition, the user accumulates points by crushing candy.

Each candy crushed is equivalent to one point.

The user continues to crush candy until the number of turns reaches zero.
