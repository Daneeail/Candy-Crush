# Candy-Crush

The following program mimics the basic functionalities of the popular Candy Crush game.

## Directions
The user begins with a 10 x 10 board filled with different colored candy.  
The different candy colors are represented on the board with a letter:
  r = red, b = blue, g = green, o = orange, and y = yellow
The user chooses coordinates to swap candy.  For the swap to be valid, the user must input valid coordinates that are in proximity to one another and produce a crushable set (3 or more of the same color).
Depending on the pattern produced, the swap may convert the candy into a particular type.
The different types of candy are represented on the board with a letter:
  V = vertical striped, H = horizontal striped, W = wrapped, and C = colored candy.
The converted candy crushes other candy with a particular pattern when crushed.
Combining two special candies also produced unique patterns when combined by a swap.
In addition, the user accumulates points by crushing candy.
Each candy crushed is equivalent to one point.
The user continues to crush candy until the number of turns reaches zero.
